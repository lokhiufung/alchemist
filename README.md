# Alchemist - A Ray-based High-Performance Automated Trading System

## **What is Alchemist?**

**Alchemist** is a high-performance, distributed **automated trading system** designed to seamlessly transition **quantitative research into fully automated algorithmic trading strategies**.

Built on **Ray**, Alchemist provides a scalable infrastructure for strategy execution, real-time order management, and seamless integration with market data and broker connections. Whether you’re a **quantitative researcher, algorithmic trader, or hedge fund**, Alchemist helps you **deploy, manage, and scale trading strategies efficiently**.

## **Why Alchemist?**

🚀 **Fast and Scalable** – Built with **Ray** to handle large-scale trading strategies across multiple processes and nodes.

🔌 **Seamless Integration** – Connects easily to market data providers, brokers, and exchanges.

📈 **Backtesting & Live Trading** – Develop strategies, backtest them, and switch to live trading **without rewriting code**.

⚡ **Real-Time Order Management** – Handles execution, risk management, and portfolio exposure dynamically.

🔧 **Customizable Strategy Framework** – A modular system that allows users to develop and optimize their own strategies.

Alchemist is **part of a broader quantitative trading ecosystem**, providing a structured way to move from **strategy research** to **live trading** with minimal friction.

## **Why Do You Need Alchemist?**

### **Problem: Gap from Research to Execution**

Quantitative traders often struggle with the transition from **research to live deployment** due to:

- **Scalability Issues** – Traditional execution frameworks cannot handle large-scale strategies efficiently.
- **Infrastructure Complexity** – Research environments are often disconnected from live market execution.
- **Computational Bottlenecks** – High-performance backtesting and execution require **parallelized, distributed computing**.
- **Integration Challenges** – Many systems lack easy connectivity with brokers, exchanges, and real-time market data.

### **Solution**

Alchemist **eliminates these roadblocks** by providing a fully integrated, high-performance framework that **connects research, backtesting, and execution in one system**.

Whether you’re working on **statistical arbitrage, market-making, or machine learning-based trading**, Alchemist ensures your strategies can transition **from development to live execution seamlessly**
